## Overview

E-book Reader is a comprehensive digital reading platform developed for the SE334.P21 - Programming Methods course. Built with Flutter and Firebase, this modern application transforms the digital reading experience by providing seamless cross-device synchronization, customizable reading preferences, and support for multiple e-book formats. The platform focuses on user experience, performance, and accessibility, making digital reading more enjoyable and efficient.

## Key Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Native PDF and EPUB readers with advanced rendering capabilities using Syncfusion PDF Viewer
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Real-time sync of books, bookmarks, and reading progress across all devices via Firebase
- **Secure Authentication**: Integrated Firebase Authentication with Email/Password and Google Sign-in options
- **Customizable Reading Experience**: Adjustable font sizes, dark/light themes, and Google Fonts typography
- **Smart Library Management**: Grid and list view modes with search, filter, and organization capabilities
- **Advanced Bookmarking**: Save any page or location with cross-device bookmark synchronization
- **Offline Reading**: Download books for offline access without internet connectivity

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Flutter SDK with Material Design 3 and Bloc pattern for state management
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Storage)
- **Reading Engines**: Syncfusion PDF Viewer for PDF rendering and Flutter EPUB Viewer for EPUB support
- **UI/UX**: Material Design 3 principles with Google Fonts integration
- **Cloud Services**: Firebase cloud solutions for scalability and real-time synchronization
- **Additional Libraries**: SharedPreferences, File Picker, HTTP Client for enhanced functionality

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenges included implementing smooth PDF and EPUB rendering across different screen sizes, managing complex state for reading progress and bookmarks, and ensuring reliable cloud synchronization. Key learnings involved mastering Flutter's widget lifecycle, implementing efficient state management with Bloc pattern, and integrating multiple third-party libraries for reading functionality.

## Outcome

E-book Reader successfully demonstrates modern mobile application development practices and provides:

- Seamless reading experience across PDF and EPUB formats
- Real-time cloud synchronization for cross-device continuity
- Comprehensive library management with search and organization
- Secure user authentication and data protection
- Offline reading capabilities with local storage
- Beautiful, accessible interface following Material Design 3

The project showcases the implementation of:

- **Clean Architecture** principles with proper separation of concerns
- **BLoC Pattern** for predictable state management
- **Firebase Integration** for backend services and cloud functionality
- **Cross-platform Development** optimized for Android devices
- **Modern UI/UX** with Material Design 3 and responsive design

This educational project was developed as part of the SE334.P21 - Programming Methods course, demonstrating practical application of software engineering principles in mobile development.
