## Overview

PNJP MES is a comprehensive Manufacturing Execution System developed during my internship at [PNJ Production](https://export.pnj.com.vn/), Vietnam's leading jewelry manufacturer. Built with Next.js and Spring Boot, this modern web application transforms manufacturing operations by digitizing production workflows, tracking inventory in real-time, and optimizing resource allocation. The system serves PNJ Production's extensive operations, supporting their 4.0 million items/year production capacity and 7000+ staff members across multiple manufacturing facilities.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Production Tracking**: Monitor manufacturing processes across all production lines with live status updates and progress indicators
- **Inventory Management**: Advanced inventory tracking system with real-time stock levels, material consumption, and automated reorder points
- **Quality Control Integration**: Digital quality assurance workflows with defect tracking and compliance reporting
- **Resource Planning**: Optimize workforce allocation and equipment utilization through intelligent scheduling algorithms
- **Data Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive reporting and analytics with interactive charts and KPI monitoring using Material React Table v3
- **Multi-language Support**: Bilingual interface supporting Vietnamese and English for international operations
- **Role-based Access Control**: Secure authentication and authorization system for different user roles and departments

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI components with Minimals UI design system for professional interface
- **Data Management**: TanStack Query for efficient API state management and caching
- **Data Visualization**: Material React Table v3 for advanced data grids and interactive tables
- **Icons**: Iconify for comprehensive icon library and consistent visual design
- **Backend**: Spring Boot framework for robust RESTful API development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and complex query operations
- **API Documentation**: Swagger for comprehensive API documentation and testing

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenges included integrating complex manufacturing workflows into a digital system, ensuring real-time data synchronization across multiple production lines, and designing an intuitive interface for diverse user roles from floor operators to management. Key learnings involved mastering enterprise-level Next.js applications, implementing efficient state management with TanStack Query, and understanding manufacturing operations in the jewelry industry.

## Outcome

PNJP MES successfully demonstrates enterprise application development practices and provides:

- Streamlined manufacturing processes with digital workflow management
- Real-time visibility into production operations and inventory levels
- Enhanced quality control through systematic tracking and reporting
- Improved resource utilization and operational efficiency
- Scalable architecture supporting PNJ Production's growth from 60M to 10M USD in exports
- Modern, responsive interface accessible across desktop and mobile devices

The project showcases the implementation of:

- **Enterprise Architecture** with microservices and scalable design patterns
- **Modern Frontend Development** using Next.js with TypeScript and Material-UI
- **Advanced Data Management** with TanStack Query for optimal performance
- **Database Design** optimized for manufacturing operations and reporting
- **API Development** following RESTful principles with comprehensive documentation
- **Real-time Systems** for live production monitoring and updates

This internship project was developed at PNJ Production, Vietnam's leading jewelry manufacturer with over 20 years of export experience to US, UK, Germany, and Oceania markets, demonstrating practical application of modern web technologies in industrial manufacturing environments.
